# Step 2: Execute Rename (Transactional)

## STEP GOAL:

Execute the rename decisions recorded in step 1 as a transaction. Copy the old `{skill_group}` and `{forge_group}` to the new name, rename inner directories, rewrite every in-file reference, verify no trace of the old name remains inside the new location, update the export manifest, rebuild platform context files, and only then delete the old directories. Any failure before the final delete rolls back by removing the new directories — the old skill remains intact.

## Rules

- Execute sections strictly in order — each section depends on the previous one
- Do not re-prompt the user — decisions were made in step 1
- Do not delete anything from old directories before section 8
- Do not proceed past a verification failure in section 5
- Report each section's outcome as it completes

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** This is transactional. After section 1 (copy), the old skill is untouched. If any section between 2 and 7 fails, delete `{new_skill_group}` and `{new_forge_group}`, report the failure, and halt — the old skill remains intact. Only section 8 (delete old) makes the operation irreversible. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

### 0. Re-read Version-Paths Knowledge + Resolve Helpers

Read `{versionPathsKnowledge}` again and confirm the templates (`{skill_package}`, `{skill_group}`, `{forge_version}`, `{forge_group}`) and the Rename section. Also read `{managedSectionLogic}` for the managed-section format template and the skill index rebuild rules that will be reused in section 7.

**Resolve helpers** in parallel — these are independent file-existence checks that batch into one tool-call message:

- `{atomicWriteHelper}` ← first existing path in `{atomicWriteProbeOrder}` (used in §3, §6 for crash-safe writes)
- `{updateActiveSymlinkHelper}` ← first existing path in `{updateActiveSymlinkProbeOrder}` (used in §4 for atomic symlink repair)
- `{manifestOpsHelper}` ← first existing path in `{manifestOpsProbeOrder}` (used in §6 for the manifest re-key)
- `{rebuildManagedSectionsHelper}` ← first existing path in `{rebuildManagedSectionsProbeOrder}` (used in §7.7 for between-marker swap)

If any helper has no existing candidate, release the lock and HALT (exit code 4, `halt_reason: "write-failed"`) — the rename's safety guarantees depend on these helpers and a fall-through to LLM-driven writes would silently regress atomicity.

**Lock release contract:** every halt path in this step ends with `rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"` before exiting. The terminal health-check (step 4) is the success-path release.

### 1. Copy skill_group and forge_group

**Precondition:** Both `{new_skill_group}` and `{new_forge_group}` must NOT exist (step 1 validated this in the collision check, but verify again before copying).

1. If `{new_skill_group}` or `{new_forge_group}` exists on disk: release the lock (`rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"`) and halt with "**Collision detected at execution time.** `{new_skill_group}` or `{new_forge_group}` now exists on disk — it did not exist during step 1 selection. Aborting before any files are touched." HALT (exit code 4, `halt_reason: "copy-failed"`). In headless, emit the error envelope.

2. Copy `{old_skill_group}` to `{new_skill_group}` recursively:
   - Preserve file permissions, timestamps, and symlinks
   - Equivalent to `cp -a {old_skill_group} {new_skill_group}` (preserves symlinks) or `cp -r` followed by explicit symlink re-creation in section 4
   - If the copy fails: release the lock (`rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"`) and halt with "**Copy failed:** `{old_skill_group}` → `{new_skill_group}`: {error}. No files were modified. Old skill is intact." HALT (exit code 4, `halt_reason: "copy-failed"`). In headless, emit the error envelope.

3. Copy `{old_forge_group}` to `{new_forge_group}` the same way:
   - If the copy fails: **rollback** by deleting `{new_skill_group}` (just created in step 2), release the lock (`rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"`), then halt with "**Copy failed:** `{old_forge_group}` → `{new_forge_group}`: {error}. Rolled back new skill_group. Old skill is intact." HALT (exit code 4, `halt_reason: "copy-failed"`). In headless, emit the error envelope.

**Rollback procedure for this section:** `rm -rf {new_skill_group}` and `rm -rf {new_forge_group}` (whichever exist). Old skill is untouched.

Report: "**Copied** `{old_skill_group}` → `{new_skill_group}` and `{old_forge_group}` → `{new_forge_group}`."

### 2. Rename Inner Version Directories

For each version `v` in `affected_versions`:

1. Resolve the old inner directory: `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{old_name}/`
2. Resolve the new inner directory: `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}/`
3. Rename the directory (move within the same parent): `mv {new_skill_group}/{v}/{old_name} {new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}`
4. If the old inner directory does not exist (orphaned version with no skill package), skip with a warning recorded in `section2_warnings`

**Rollback on any rename failure:**

- `rm -rf {new_skill_group}` and `rm -rf {new_forge_group}`
- Release the lock: `rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"`
- Halt with: "**Inner directory rename failed** at `{v}/{old_name}`: {error}. Rolled back both new directories. Old skill is intact." HALT (exit code 4, `halt_reason: "write-failed"`). In headless, emit the error envelope.

Report: "**Renamed {count} inner directories** to `{new_name}/`."

### 3. Update File Contents Inside the New Location

For each version `v` in `affected_versions`, operate on the files inside `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}/` (the freshly renamed inner directory) and `{new_forge_group}/{v}/`:

**Write semantics (apply to 3a / 3b / 3c / 3d):** Compute the new file content in memory (LLM judgment work), then pipe it to `{atomicWriteHelper} write <target>` so the rewrite is staged in `<target>.skf-tmp`, fsync'd, and atomically renamed into place. A process kill or disk-full event mid-rewrite leaves the original file intact — no half-written artifacts.

```bash
echo "{new_content}" | python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write "{target_path}"
```

**3a. SKILL.md frontmatter:**

- Path: `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}/SKILL.md`
- In the YAML frontmatter (between the leading `---` markers), replace the `name:` field value from `{old_name}` to `{new_name}`
- Only replace within the frontmatter block — do not substitute matches inside the body text
- Pipe via `{atomicWriteHelper} write` per the write semantics above
- If the file is missing, record it in `section3_warnings` and continue

**3b. metadata.json:**

- Path: `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}/metadata.json`
- Parse the JSON, set `name` = `{new_name}`, write back preserving formatting via `{atomicWriteHelper} write`
- If the file is missing, record it in `section3_warnings` and continue

**3c. context-snippet.md:**

- Path: `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}/context-snippet.md`
- Replace the display name header `[{old_name} v...]` → `[{new_name} v...]` (preserving the version suffix)
- Rewrite every `root:` path that references the old name to use the new name. Parse the `root:` line as `root: {prefix}{old_name}/`, preserve the prefix as-is, and replace `{old_name}` with `{new_name}`. This generically handles any IDE's skill root path (e.g., `.claude/skills/`, `.windsurf/skills/`, `.github/skills/`) as well as the draft `skills/` prefix and legacy forms — no enumeration of known prefixes needed.
  - Example: `root: .windsurf/skills/{old_name}/` → `root: .windsurf/skills/{new_name}/`
  - Example: `root: skills/{old_name}/` → `root: skills/{new_name}/`
  - Legacy pre-fix form `root: skills/{old_name}/active/{old_name}/` → `root: skills/{new_name}/` (normalize to flat form during rename)
- Pipe via `{atomicWriteHelper} write` per the write semantics above
- If the file is missing, record it in `section3_warnings` and continue

**3d. provenance-map.json:**

- Path: `{new_forge_group}/{v}/provenance-map.json`
- Parse JSON, set `skill_name` = `{new_name}`, write back via `{atomicWriteHelper} write`
- If the file is missing (some versions may not have a provenance map), record it in `section3_warnings` and continue

**Rollback on any update failure (not just a missing file):**

- `rm -rf {new_skill_group}` and `rm -rf {new_forge_group}`
- Release the lock: `rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"`
- Halt with: "**File update failed** at `{path}`: {error}. Rolled back both new directories. Old skill is intact." HALT (exit code 4, `halt_reason: "write-failed"`). In headless, emit the error envelope.

Report: "**Updated file contents** across {affected_versions_count} version(s): SKILL.md, metadata.json, context-snippet.md, provenance-map.json."

### 4. Fix the `active` Symlink in the New Location

Recreate or repair the `active` symlink in `{new_skill_group}` via `{updateActiveSymlinkHelper}` — the helper holds an `flock` on `{new_skill_group}/active.lock`, surfaces a clear error on Windows non-dev-mode (no silent fallback), and uses the `ln -sfn tmp && mv -Tf tmp link` pattern to make the flip atomic against concurrent readers.

1. Inspect `{old_skill_group}/active` to determine the target version (the value the symlink points to — typically just the version string, not an absolute path). If `{old_skill_group}/active` does not exist, skip this section — there is no symlink to repair.
2. Invoke:

   ```bash
   python3 {updateActiveSymlinkHelper} flip-link \
     --link {new_skill_group}/active \
     --target {target_version}
   ```

3. The helper handles all four cases (missing, present-and-correct, present-and-stale, present-and-invalid) uniformly via atomic replace.

**Rollback on helper non-zero exit:**

- `rm -rf {new_skill_group}` and `rm -rf {new_forge_group}`
- Release the lock: `rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"`
- Halt with: "**Failed to repair `active` symlink** in `{new_skill_group}`: {captured stderr}. Rolled back both new directories. Old skill is intact." HALT (exit code 4, `halt_reason: "write-failed"`). In headless, emit the error envelope.

### 5. Verify — No Trace of `{old_name}` Inside the New Location

This is the commit-point check. If any match is found, the rename is not safe to commit.

For every version `v` in `affected_versions`, grep (literal substring, case-sensitive) for `{old_name}` in:

- `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}/SKILL.md`
- `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}/metadata.json`
- `{new_skill_group}/{v}/{new_name}/context-snippet.md`
- `{new_forge_group}/{v}/provenance-map.json`

Also check the directory listing itself:

- `{new_skill_group}/{v}/` should contain `{new_name}/` and MUST NOT contain `{old_name}/`

**Important nuance:** body text of SKILL.md may legitimately mention the old name (e.g., historical notes, changelog, cross-references). The grep is allowed to match within SKILL.md body text ONLY if the match is clearly informational (surrounding prose, not a structural reference). For the purposes of this step, treat any match in `metadata.json`, `context-snippet.md`, `provenance-map.json`, or the SKILL.md frontmatter block as a hard failure. Matches inside the SKILL.md body below the closing `---` are recorded as `verification_warnings` but do not block the rename.

**On hard failure (any structural reference to `{old_name}` remains):**

- `rm -rf {new_skill_group}` and `rm -rf {new_forge_group}`
- Release the lock: `rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"`
- Halt with: "**Verification failed.** `{old_name}` still appears in: {list of paths}. Rolled back both new directories. Old skill is intact." HALT (exit code 5, `halt_reason: "verify-failed"`). In headless, emit the error envelope.

Report: "**Verified** — no structural references to `{old_name}` remain inside the new location across {affected_versions_count} version(s). {if verification_warnings is non-empty: 'Informational body-text mentions retained in SKILL.md: {list}.'}"

### 6. Update Export Manifest

**If `manifest_exists = false` (step 1 recorded no manifest on disk):**

Skip this section entirely. Set `manifest_updated = false` and `manifest_backup = null`. There is no manifest to re-key — the skill was never exported. Section 7 will find no platform context files to rebuild either (no manifest means no prior export, so no `<!-- SKF:BEGIN -->` markers exist), and any platform file that happens to be present will be left alone by the section 2 marker check.

Report: "**Manifest update skipped** — no `.export-manifest.json` on disk. The rename is a pure on-disk operation."

**If `manifest_exists = true`:**

1. **Hold a deep copy in memory** as `manifest_backup` — required for rollback in this section and section 7 on failure. Read `{skills_output_folder}/.export-manifest.json` once and stash the parsed object.
2. **Re-key via the helper.** If the manifest contains `exports.{old_name}`, invoke:

   ```bash
   python3 {manifestOpsHelper} {skills_output_folder} rename {old_name} {new_name}
   ```

   The helper preserves `active_version`, `versions` map, and all fields, then writes the manifest atomically via temp + rename. If the manifest does NOT contain `exports.{old_name}` (the skill was on disk but never exported), skip the invocation — the manifest has nothing to change.

**Rollback on helper non-zero exit:**

- Restore the manifest from `manifest_backup` via `{atomicWriteHelper} write {skills_output_folder}/.export-manifest.json` (re-pipe the JSON-serialized backup)
- `rm -rf {new_skill_group}` and `rm -rf {new_forge_group}`
- Release the lock: `rm -f "{forge_data_folder}/{old_name}/.skf-rename.lock"`
- Halt with: "**Manifest update failed:** {captured stderr}. Restored manifest from backup and rolled back new directories. Old skill is intact." HALT (exit code 4, `halt_reason: "manifest-write-failed"`). In headless, emit the error envelope.

Set context flag `manifest_updated = true`.

Report: "**Manifest updated** — re-keyed `exports.{old_name}` → `exports.{new_name}`."

### 7. Rebuild Context Files

Load `references/rebuild-context.md` and follow its per-IDE managed-section sweep. The reference resolves `target_context_files` from `config.yaml.ides` (via `{managedSectionLogic}`'s mapping table), iterates each context file, builds the exported skill set (version-aware, deprecated-excluded — the manifest re-key from §6 is already in effect so `{new_name}` is present and `{old_name}` is absent), rewrites root paths via the §4d algorithm, assembles the new managed section, and invokes `{rebuildManagedSectionsHelper}` for the surgical between-marker swap.

After the loop returns, the workflow context contains:

- `context_files_updated` — list of files successfully rewritten
- `context_files_failed` — list of any that failed (per-file failures do not halt the rename — the manifest and filesystem are already canonical state, so context files can be re-rebuilt later via `[EX] Export Skill`)

Report per the reference's after-loop block, then proceed to §8.

**Note:** §7 failures do not trigger a rollback. Platform context files are derived artifacts; the manifest and on-disk skill directories are the canonical state.

### 8. Delete Old Directories (Point of No Return)

This is the only section after which rollback is impossible. By this point:

- `{new_skill_group}` is fully materialized with all inner directories renamed and files updated
- `{new_forge_group}` is fully materialized with `skill_name` updated in every provenance map
- No structural references to `{old_name}` remain inside either new directory (verified in section 5)
- The manifest has been re-keyed (section 6)
- Platform context files reference `{new_name}` (section 7, best-effort)

Execute the deletes:

1. Verify `{old_skill_group}` is inside `{skills_output_folder}` (defense in depth)
2. `rm -rf {old_skill_group}` — delete the old skill_group recursively
3. Verify deletion succeeded (the path no longer exists)
4. Verify `{old_forge_group}` is inside `{forge_data_folder}` (defense in depth)
5. `rm -rf {old_forge_group}` — delete the old forge_group recursively
6. Verify deletion succeeded

**On deletion error:**

- Record the error in `deletion_errors` against the specific path
- Continue attempting the other path — partial cleanup is still better than none
- Do NOT attempt any rollback — the new name is already committed and the old name's remnants can be removed manually

Report: "**Deleted old directories:** `{old_skill_group}` and `{old_forge_group}`. {if deletion_errors is non-empty: 'Errors: {list} — remove manually with `rm -rf {path}`.'}"

### 9. Store Results in Context

Store the following for step 3:

- `old_name` — the previous skill name
- `new_name` — the new skill name
- `affected_versions` — list of versions that were renamed
- `affected_versions_count` — integer count
- `files_updated_per_version` — structured summary (SKILL.md, metadata.json, context-snippet.md, provenance-map.json — each with ×count)
- `manifest_rekeyed` — boolean (true if section 6 succeeded)
- `context_files_updated` — list of successfully rebuilt files
- `context_files_failed` — list of files that failed to rebuild (empty if none)
- `section2_warnings` — list of orphaned version warnings (empty if none)
- `section3_warnings` — list of missing file warnings (empty if none)
- `verification_warnings` — list of informational SKILL.md body mentions of `{old_name}` retained (empty if none)
- `deletion_errors` — list of post-commit deletion errors (empty if none)

### 10. Load Next Step

Load, read the full file, and then execute `{nextStepFile}`.

## Error Handling Summary

| Section | Failure Mode | Reversible? | Recovery Action |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Copy failure | Yes | Delete whichever new directory exists; old skill intact |
| 2 | Inner rename failure | Yes | `rm -rf` both new directories; old skill intact |
| 3 | File update failure | Yes | `rm -rf` both new directories; old skill intact |
| 4 | `active` symlink repair failure | Yes | `rm -rf` both new directories; old skill intact |
| 5 | Verification failure | Yes | `rm -rf` both new directories; old skill intact |
| 6 | Manifest write failure | Yes | Restore manifest from backup; `rm -rf` both new directories; old skill intact |
| 7 | Platform context rebuild failure | Per-file | Record errors, continue other platforms; do NOT rollback — manifest and disk are canonical |
| 8 | Delete failure | **No** | Record deletion errors; new name is already committed; user removes remnants manually |

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN all execution sections have been attempted (copy, inner rename, file updates, symlink fix, verification, manifest re-key, context rebuild, old delete) and results have been stored in context, will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to generate the final report.
