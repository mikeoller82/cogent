# Step 6: Workflow Health Check

## STEP GOAL:

Chain to the shared workflow self-improvement health check at `{nextStepFile}`. This is the terminal step of brief-skill — after the shared health check completes, the workflow is fully done.

## Rules

- No user-facing reports, file writes, or result contracts in this step — those belong in step 5
- Delegate directly to `{nextStepFile}` with no additional commentary
- Do not attempt any other action between loading this step and executing `{nextStepFile}`
- All user-facing output in `{communication_language}`

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

Load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it.

## Completion criteria

This is the terminal step of brief-skill. The workflow is complete when `{nextStepFile}` returns control — do not transition to any further step.

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

Step 06 is the terminal stage of brief-skill. After `{nextStepFile}` returns control, the brief-skill workflow is fully complete — do not re-enter step 5 or step 6, do not load any further step file, and do not loop back into the workflow.
