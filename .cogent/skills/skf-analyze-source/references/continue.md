# Step 1b: Continue Analysis

## STEP GOAL:

To resume the analyze-source workflow from where it was left off in a previous session by reading the analysis report's progress state and routing to the correct next step.

## Rules

- Focus only on reading state and routing — do not perform any analysis
- Do not re-run completed steps
- Present progress summary to user before resuming

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Welcome Back

"**Welcome back!** Let me check where we left off with the source analysis..."

### 2. Read Progress State

Load {outputFile} and read frontmatter:
- `stepsCompleted` array
- `project_paths`
- `project_name`
- `forge_tier`
- `existing_skills`
- `confirmed_units`

### 3. Present Progress Summary

"**Analysis Progress for {project_name}:**

**Project:** {project_paths}
**Forge Tier:** {forge_tier}
**Steps Completed:** {list stepsCompleted}
**Last Step:** {last entry in stepsCompleted}

**Progress:**
{For each completed step, summarize what was accomplished — read the relevant sections from the report}"

### 4. Determine Next Step

Map the last completed step to the next step file:

| Last Completed | Next Step |
|----------------|-----------|
| init | scan-project |
| scan-project | identify-units |
| identify-units | map-and-detect |
| map-and-detect | recommend |
| recommend | generate-briefs |
| generate-briefs | health-check |

**IF `health-check` is in `stepsCompleted`:**
"**This analysis appears to be complete.** All steps have been finished. Would you like to start a new analysis?"

### 5. Update and Route

Update {outputFile} frontmatter:
```yaml
lastContinued: '{current_date}'
```

"**Resuming from {next_step_name}...**"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- After progress is confirmed, immediately load, read entire file, then execute the appropriate step from {nextStepOptions}

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- This is an auto-proceed continuation step
- Route directly to the next incomplete step

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the progress state has been read, summarized to the user, and lastContinued updated will you load the appropriate next step file to resume the workflow.
