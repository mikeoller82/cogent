# Step 2: Detect Mode

## STEP GOAL:

Examine the skill metadata to determine whether this is an individual skill (naive mode — API surface coverage only) or a stack skill (contextual mode — full coherence validation including cross-references and integration patterns).

### 1. Examine Skill Type

Read the skill metadata (loaded in step 01) and check:

**Individual Skill indicators:**
- `skill_type: 'single'` in metadata
- Single source library/package
- No cross-references to other skills
- Self-contained API surface

**Stack Skill indicators:**
- `skill_type: 'stack'` in metadata
- References multiple skills or packages
- Contains cross-references in SKILL.md
- Integration patterns documented between components

### 2. Determine Test Mode

**IF individual skill → Naive Mode:**
- Coverage check: documented exports vs source API surface
- Coherence check: basic structural validation only (no cross-references to verify)
- Scoring: redistributed weights (no coherence category)

**IF stack skill → Contextual Mode:**
- Coverage check: documented exports vs source API surface (same as naive)
- Coherence check: full validation — cross-references exist, types match, integration patterns complete
- Scoring: full category weights including coherence

**IF metadata unclear or skill_type not set:**
- Default to **naive mode** (conservative — fewer checks, less chance of false negatives from missing context)
- Note the default in the report

**Quick-tier adjustment (applies to both modes):** If `forge_tier` is `Quick`, Signature Accuracy and Type Coverage are skipped during scoring (no AST available). Their weights are redistributed proportionally to remaining active categories. See `scoring-rules.md` Tier-Dependent Scoring section for details.

### 3. Update Output Document

Update `{outputFile}` frontmatter:
- Set `testMode: '{naive|contextual}'`

Append the **Test Summary** section to `{outputFile}`:

```markdown
## Test Summary

**Skill:** {skill_name}
**Test Mode:** {naive|contextual}
**Forge Tier:** {detected_tier}

**Mode Rationale:** {brief explanation of why this mode was selected}

**Analysis Plan:**
- Coverage Check: {what will be checked based on mode + tier}
- Coherence Check: {what will be checked based on mode + tier}
```

### 4. Report Mode Detection

"**Mode detected: {NAIVE|CONTEXTUAL}**

**{skill_name}** is {an individual skill / a stack skill}, so we'll run in **{naive/contextual}** mode.

**What this means:**
- Coverage: {brief description of coverage scope}
- Coherence: {brief description of coherence scope}
- Scoring: {which weight distribution applies}

**Proceeding to coverage check...**"

Update stepsCompleted, then load and execute {nextStepFile}.
