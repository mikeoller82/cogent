# Snippet Root Prefix Mismatch — Pre-flight Probe

## Purpose

Catch the authoring-repo case before step 4 silently rewrites root paths. In an authoring repo, skills typically live under a single shared directory (`skills/`) that does not match any per-IDE `skill_root` (`.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, etc.). Without this probe, step 4's root-rewrite algorithm would replace the on-disk prefix with an IDE-mapped one that the snippet files do not actually reside under.

Loaded by `load-skill.md` §1b after `target_context_files` is resolved and `snippet_skill_root_override` is confirmed unset.

## Inputs

- `target_context_files[0].skill_root` — the reference IDE-mapped skill root (used because step 3 §2.7 picks this same entry for snippet generation when no override is set)
- `{skills_output_folder}` — for manifest-driven candidate enumeration
- Current skill's snippet path (resolved via manifest / `active` symlink / flat path per `knowledge/version-paths.md`)
- `{headless_mode}` — boolean flag from workflow context

## Probe Algorithm

1. Collect candidate snippet paths:
   - Read `{skills_output_folder}/.export-manifest.json` if it exists. For each skill in `exports` with a resolvable `active_version`, add `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/{active_version}/{skill-name}/context-snippet.md`.
   - Also include the current skill's snippet if present.
2. For each snippet that exists on disk, read the first line and parse the `root:` value. Strip the trailing `{skill-name}/` to extract the prefix (e.g. `skills/`, `.claude/skills/`).
3. Collect unique prefixes into `observed_prefixes`.
4. Compare against `target_context_files[0].skill_root` (the reference).

## Mismatch Gate

**If `observed_prefixes` contains any value that does not match the reference `skill_root`:**

Emit a single warning (once, not per snippet) and present resolution options before continuing to §2:

> **Snippet root prefix mismatch detected.**
> Existing snippets use: `{observed_prefixes}`
> IDE-mapped skill_root:  `{target_context_files[0].skill_root}`
>
> This usually means you are in an authoring repo where skills live under a single shared directory. Options:
>
> - **(a) Set override** — add `snippet_skill_root_override: {observed_prefix}` to `config.yaml`. Snippets keep their on-disk prefix; the managed section references the real location.
> - **(b) Proceed with IDE mapping** — step 4 will rewrite every snippet's root path to the IDE's skill_root. Use this only if the IDE's skill directory actually contains the skill files.
> - **(c) Cancel** — abort export and investigate.
> - **(d) Use observed prefix for this run only** — set the effective snippet root to the single observed on-disk prefix for this export run, without writing to `config.yaml`. The managed section references the real on-disk location. (Only offered when exactly one prefix was observed.)
>
> If multiple distinct prefixes were observed, the snippets disagree with each other — investigate before choosing (a) or (d).

Wait for user choice.

**Headless default:** when `{headless_mode}`, default to **(b) Proceed with IDE mapping** and log the observed prefix(es) so the mismatch is visible in run logs (not silent).

## Choice handling

### (a) Set override

Halt and instruct the user to update `config.yaml` with `snippet_skill_root_override: {observed_prefix}`, then re-run export. Exit code 6, `halt_reason: "user-cancelled"` (configuration change is out-of-band — workflow does not edit config.yaml on the user's behalf).

### (b) Proceed with IDE mapping

Continue to §2. Step 4's root-rewrite algorithm will rewrite every snippet's prefix to the reference `skill_root`. The user is accepting that the IDE's skill directory contains the actual files; if it does not, the resulting managed section will reference paths that don't resolve.

### (c) Cancel

HALT. Exit code 6, `halt_reason: "user-cancelled"`. No files written.

### (d) Use observed prefix for this run only

**Only available when `observed_prefixes` contains exactly one value.** Set the effective snippet root for this run to that single observed prefix — do NOT mutate `config.yaml`. Step 4's root-rewrite algorithm uses this value as the reference instead of `target_context_files[0].skill_root`, so snippets keep their on-disk prefix and the managed section resolves to the real location. Print a one-line hint: "Persist `snippet_skill_root_override: {observed_prefix}` in config.yaml to skip this prompt on future exports." Continue to §2.

## No-mismatch fast path

**If all observed prefixes match the reference `skill_root` (or no existing snippets were found):** no warning, no gate. Return control to §1b and proceed silently to §2.
